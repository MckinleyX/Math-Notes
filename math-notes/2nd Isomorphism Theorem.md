If $K,N$ are subgroups of $G$ with $N \triangleleft G$, then $K/(N \cap K) \cong NK/N$, where $NK$ is defined in the natural way.
$\Pf$ Define $f : K \to NK/N$ by
$$K \xrightarrow{\iota} NK \xrightarrow{\pi} NK/N,$$
where $\iota$ is the inclusion map, and $\pi$ is the natural map.
By the [[1st Isomorphism Theorem]], 
$$K/\ker(f) = \Img(f),$$ and because $f$ is surjective and $\ker f = K \cap N$, $K/(K \cap N) = NK/N$ and we are done. $$\qed$$
