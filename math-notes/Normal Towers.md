## Normal Tower
Let $G$ be a group. A *tower* of subgroups is a sequence
$$G = G_1 \supset G_2 \supset \cdots \supset G_n.$$
A tower is *normal* if $G_{i+1} \triangleleft G_i$ for all $i$.
## Composition Series
A *composition series* is a normal tower where $G_n = 0$ and $G_i / G_{i+1}$ is simple for all $i$.
### Jordan-Holder
Let $G$ be a group, and let 
$$G = G_0 \supset G_1 \supset \cdots \supset G_r = 0$$ and 
$$G = H_0 \supset H_1 \supset \cdots \supset H_k = 0.$$
Then there exists a bijection $f : [r] \to [k]$ such that $G_i/G_{i+1} \simeq G_{f(i)}/G_{f(i)+1}$.
