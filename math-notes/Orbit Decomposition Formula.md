# Orbit Decomposition Formula
Let $G$ act on $S$. Note that any 2 orbits are either disjoint or the same. 

So $S = \bigsqcup_{i \in I} Gs_i$ , where $I$ is some index set of a set of representatives of orbits.
If $S$ is finite then $S = \bigsqcup_{i=1}^n Gs_i$, so $|S| = \sum_{i=1}^n |Gs_i|$. 
But $|Gs_i| = [G:G_{s_i}]$, so $$|S| = \sum_{i=1}^n [G:G_{s_i}].$$
This is the orbit decomposition formula.
