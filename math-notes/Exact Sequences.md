## Exact Sequences
Let $G, G', G''$ be groups, and $f : G' \to G$ and $g : G \to G'$ be group homomorphisms. This is expressed as $$G' \xrightarrow{f} G \xrightarrow{g} G''$$ and is called *exact* when $\Img f = \ker g$. ^defn
## Example
Let $G$ be a group and $H$ be a normal subgroup of $G$. Then  
$$H \xrightarrow{\iota} G \xrightarrow{\pi} G/H$$ 
is an exact sequence. In fact, you can add 0s on both ends:
$$0 \to H \xrightarrow{\iota} G \xrightarrow{\pi} G/H \to 0$$
this is a short exact sequence.
